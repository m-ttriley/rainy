# rainy

This is just a little JS code you can copy and paste into your html in order to create a little pixel rain effect.

The div containing the rain will grow and shrink with the window size, so it will not effect the size of your
page in any way. Due to this, it also works well on mobile right off the bat, no media queries necessary.
